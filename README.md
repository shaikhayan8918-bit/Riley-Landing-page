            <p>Three years ago, I was you.</p>
            
            <p>I'd launched four different startups. All failures.</p>
            
            <p>I'd spent $30,000 of my own money. Worked 80-hour weeks. Built products that took months to develop.</p>
            
            <p><span class="bold">Zero revenue.</span></p>
            
            <p>I was about to give up and go back to my corporate job when I met a founder who'd built and sold three companies.</p>
            
            <p>Over coffee, he drew three letters on a napkin:</p>
            
            <p class="center large-text bold">P-S-D</p>

            <p>30 days later, I had my first $10,000 month.</p>
            
            <p>Not from a complex app. Not from months of development.</p>
            
            <p class="bold">From a simple solution to a real problem that I could sell immediately.</p>
            
            <p>That napkin sketch became the PSD Framework.</p>

            <h2>The PSD Framework: Why It Works When Everything Else Fails</h2>
            
            <p>Here's why 90% of startups fail...</p>
            
            <p>They start with the solution. They build first, then try to find buyers.</p>
            
            <p class="bold">But successful founders do it backwards.</p>
            
            <div class="framework-steps">
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>P - PROBLEM</h3>
                    <p>Find the biggest pain point in your target market. Not what you think they need. What they're actively complaining about and willing to pay to solve.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>S - SOLUTION</h3>
                    <p>Create the minimum viable solution. Not a perfect product. A quick, testable offer that solves the problem you identified in step 1.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>D - DISTRIBUTION</h3>
                    <p>Get it in front of people immediately. Through your network, referrals, and simple outreach. No waiting for the "perfect launch."</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p class="bold">Here's the difference:</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold">Old way:</span> Spend 6 months building â†’ Launch â†’ Hope people want it â†’ Usually get zero sales</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold">PSD way:</span> Find problem â†’ Draft quick solution â†’ Test with real people â†’ Make money while you iterate</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This isn't theory. This is the exact process I used to go from $0 to $10K in 30 days.</p>
            
            <p>And it's what my clients use to:</p>
            
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li><span class="bold">Generate their first $1K in 7 days</span> instead of waiting months for "product-market fit"</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Validate ideas before building anything</span> so they never waste time on products nobody wants</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Turn networking conversations into paying customers</span> instead of just "picking people's brains"</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Build confidence as real entrepreneurs</span> instead of feeling like imposters who can't close deals</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"I was stuck at $2K months for a year. Riley walked me through PSD and I hit $12K the next month. Same business, completely different approach."</p>

            <h2>The Questions Every Smart Founder Asks</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I afford this before my business is making money?</h3>
                <p>The strategy call is completely free. And here's what I've learned: you can't afford NOT to get help. Every month you spend building the wrong thing or targeting the wrong market costs you thousands in lost revenue and wasted time. Most of my clients make back their investment in their first month by finally focusing on what actually drives sales.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Will this actually work for me, or did it just work for Riley?</h3>
                <p>I get it. You've been burned by guru promises before. That's exactly why I offer the free strategy call first. You'll see the PSD Framework in action on your own business before making any commitment. Plus, this isn't some untested theory - it's the same approach used by every successful bootstrap founder I know. The framework works because it's based on what customers actually want, not what we think they want.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I can't execute the outreach part?</h3>
                <p>That's exactly what I help with. I don't just tell you to "do outreach" - I give you the specific scripts, strategies, and step-by-step process I use. Plus, we start with your existing network first, then expand from there. You're not cold-calling strangers. You're having strategic conversations with people who already know and trust you.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I don't have weeks or months to waste on another program.</h3>
                <p>Perfect. Because PSD isn't about long programs. It's about fast results. Most clients see their first sales within 2-3 weeks of implementing the framework. We're not building perfect products - we're validating problems and creating quick solutions people will pay for immediately. Speed is the point.</p>
